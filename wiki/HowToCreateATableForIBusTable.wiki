= For input method developers =
It is recommended to split database building and index creating,
as it makes distro packagers' life easier.

Use *-o* option of _ibus-table-create_ to build database without creating index;
use *-i* option of _ibus-table-create_ to create index without building database.

= For packagers =
Install the database file which is built by _ibus-table-create_ *-o*,
and create index with _ibus-table-create_ *-i* in your post-install script script.
