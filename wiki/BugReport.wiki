# How to file the bug report #
Please file ibus bug report by component; ibus, ibus-qt, ibus-anthy, ibus-pinyin, etc.

If you don't know which component you should file, you can file your problem to [ibus](https://github.com/ibus/ibus/issues) core and ibus maintainers will evaluate the isssues and ask the reporter or the component maintainers to file the problem to the right component.

The old issues in [https://code.google.com/p/ibus/issues/list](https://code.google.com/p/ibus/issues/list) are moved to [https://github.com/ibus/ibus/issues](https://github.com/ibus/ibus/issues) at the moment. But github.com issues can be looked by the github users only. To notify a github user, you can write "@username" on the github issue report. Roughly code.google.com issue ID + about 20, 21, 22 == github.com issue ID.
