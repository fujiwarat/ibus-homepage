= ibus-pinyin =
== I'm using Arch. ibus-pinyin is always in Double Pinyin (双拼) mode! ==
Please use ibus-libpinyin instead, it is available in Community repo.

ibus-libpinyin's UI is very similar to that of ibus-pinyin.

If you want to help us, please continue discussion in Issue 1542

= ibus-table =

== I cannot input Traditional Chinese characters with table-XXX! ==
Most likely, it is because your Chinese mode is not appropriate.

You can use Ctrl+; to switch Chinese mode.

If your mode cannot be saved, you may change get_chinese_mode function in /usr/share/ibus-table/engine/table.py to set your own global (apply to all tables) default.

We already know that the above solution is not good enough, please refer to Issue 1188.

== How can I change number of candidates in table-XXX? ==
you may change {{{_page_size = 6}}} (change 6 to value you want) in /usr/share/ibus-table/engine/table.py to set your own global (apply to all tables) default.

We already know that the above solution is not good enough, please refer to Issue 1474.

== How can I change the behavior of Space Key in table-XXX? I want to use Space Key as next page rather than commit. ==
You may use the hacks found in the following page, check history version if needed.

http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBus

They are global (apply to all tables) change also. We haven't verified them yet.

We already know that the above solution is not good enough, please refer to Issue 861.
